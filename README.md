<h1>INTRODUCTION:-<h3/>
         <p2>Scotch whisky is prized for its complexity and variety of flavors in  the regions of Scotland where it is produced are believed to have distinct flavor profiles.In this project , we will classify scotch whiskies based on their flavor characteristics.The dataset we’ll be using contains a selection of scotch whiskies from several distilleries, and we’ll attempt to cluster whiskies into groups that are similar in flavor.<p2/><h1/>


<h3>2.OBJECTIVE<p3>To make cluster of scotch whisky based on their flavour characteristics.<p3/>









<h3>3.DATA SET <h3/>
         <p4>3.1  source of Data set-        Whisyk Advocate:
Whisky Advocate is America’s leading whisky publication. It’s a premier source for whisky information, education and entertainment for whisky enthusiasts.

The site is one of the most famous whisky webpage. And descriptions included in the dataset are reviewd by authorized whisky reviewers.<p4/>






<p5><p>3.2 Data set discription and feature:-<p>
         The whisky  dataset contins 86 rows of malt whisky test scores and 17 columns of taste categories and region dataset contains 86 rows of malt whisky location in scotland.The dataset we’ll be using consists of tasting ratings of one readily available single malt scotch whisky from almost every active whisky distillery in Scotland.The resulting dataset has 86 malt whiskies that are scored (dummy variables) between 0 and 4 in 12 different taste categories.The scores have been aggregated from 10 different professional whisky tasters.The taste categories describe whether the whiskies are sweet, smoky, medicinal, spicy, and so on.<p5/>
